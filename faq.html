        Review:

        I feel that I could of benefited in terms of increased productivity with an 
        external display to use when writting my code also a generally more ergonomic 
        workspace, this would of improved my efficency aswell by allowing me to write 
        more code quicker and requiring less time away from the computer. I also think
        that my work could of been improved by working in a team or getting external input
        helping me to better formulate my idea and then transforming that into a website.
